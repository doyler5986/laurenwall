    <h1>My Animals</h1>
    <p>Back at home I spent a lot of my time with my animals. We have two dogs, a pony and two rams. We did have two chickens but sadly a fox attcked them and they didn't make it. But their names were Chicken Littlw and Phil. Phil was short for Fillet which I personally thought was a great name but I've heard mixed reviews. However, all the other animals are still here thank God. Our two dogs are Jack Russels and are completly spoiled rotten. Our pony's name is Bob and I have never met an animal with more personality. The two rams we don't really spend time with apart from feeding them and trying to see where they are in the field. Their names are Fifi and Daisy. My siser and I named them before we knew thwy were rams and not sheep but we just thought it was funny to keep their names as that</p>
    
    <h2>Mutzer</h2>
    <p> <img src=images/mutz%202.jpg alt="Mutzer" width="250" height="240"></p>
    <p>Mutz is my first dog. He just recently turned 12 and I've had him since I was in 1st class in priary school. He's honestly my best little buddy and what I miss most about home while being away for college. He is 84 in dog years and he couldn't act like more of an old man. He spends most of his time snoozing and eating and he is fairly along in terms of weight. His left ear always falls off to the side and the other always falls straight down. We have no idea why but ever since he was a puppy it's always been that way.</p>

    </p>
    
    <p>As you can see above, he makes himself completly at home on my bed. Once he falls asleep in a little sun spot, he will not be moving fro at least an hour. </p>

    <p>As we can clearly see here, Mutzer is extremly photogenic. Sadly for him, I have quite a few pictures looking very similar to this one. I feel like if he was a human he would fullybhate me for taking them. But thankfully for me he is only an only mildly smart dog and loves me very conditionally. And those conditions are only when I have food that he wants and when I let him sleep in my bed.

    <h3>Bear/Pup</h3>
    <p>Bear is the baby of the family.  We got him back in December 2019.  H    e answers to Bear, Pup and Rot, mostly because we spend a lot of time giving out to him. He isn't a dog you would exactly call a smart puppy. Quite the opposite really. And I feel like that might be mine and my sisters fault.  He was only with us about two days and we had him sitting on the bottom step of the stairs playing with him, took our eyes off him for maybe two seconds and next thing we knew he walked off the step and fell straight onto his head, because obviously he didn't realise there was a drop. After that incident he has always been a bit...strange...for lack of a better word.</p>

    <p>
        He, much like Mutzer, is a very photogenic dog as shown above. He seems to think he is as big as the sheepdog mix lying in front of him and even squared up to a great dane once. The great dane didn't even bother to look at him and kept walking, which I feel like Bear should be greatful for. He is extremly scared of most things in the world. He will stop walking compleltly when a car drives by and refuses to stand back up until it is far away enough. Yet for some reason this fear doesn't occur when he sees dogs about fifty times his size.</p>

    <p>Bear wasn't the most cute puppy in the world but he certainly was special. For the first few months the only word to describe him was 'Alien'.Not much has changed since then I'm  affraid.</p>

    <h4>Bob</h4>
    <p> <img src=images/bob%201.jpg alt=Bob width="200" height="240"></p>
    <p>Bob is the two year ld pony that a family friend keeps in one of our fields. He is a very vocal pony and whinnies at us every time we walk out the back door so we go over and pet him. However, he also whinnies very loudly when he sees us going to feed any animal but him. Even if he has already eaten, he will still expect us to bring him out something when we feed the rams or the dogs. Any fruit or veg we don't eat goes into 'Bob's Bucket' and he gets it at the end of every day.  Although we love him, he can get on our nerves. He has a nasty habit of somehow getting out of his field and ending up in our garden. Within the first week of him coming to us he had escaped maybe four times. One day we came home and he had his in one of the wheely bins eating what we threw out afyer dinner.  We had to lue him bakck to his field with even more food, as it was the only way to get him to follow us.</p>
