    <h1>My Favourite Music</h1>
    
    <p>I have a very odd tatse in music. It's very mixed and can never seem to fall under one category. If you looked at my liked songs on spotify, you could go from a song by Drake, straight away followed by For the Dancing and the Dreaming from How To Train Your Dragon. Which is a great song that I highly reccommend.  Music plays a huge part in my life, and I would be lost without it. Nearly every minute of the day I have some sort of music playing. </p>
    
    <h2>Some of my favourite artists</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>P!nk</li>
        <li>5SOS</li>
        <li>Black Veil Brides</li>
        <li>ABBA</li>
        <li>SAARLOOS</li>
        <li>Niall Horan</li>
        <li>Post Malone</li>
        <li>Gavin James</li>
        <li>Panic!</li>
        <li>Hot Chelle Rae</li>
        <li>Twenty One Pilots</li>

        <li>Macklemore</li>
        <li>Fall Out Boy</li>
        <li>Drake</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I was raised in a very musical family and grew up going to my grandad's choir practices with him and always listening to my uncle play on his guitar way too loud in my grandparents house.  As long as I can remember there was always music playing and someone in my family would be making me learn the words to a random song, and naturally that made me grow a love from songs from the early 2000's and more specifically the year I was born 2001.</p>

    <p>P!nk is one of my top artists of all time. Mam would have her music blaring the whole time in the car. It got to the stage where I could sing along to almost all of her songs by age five. I'm not sure if it was the most appropriate music for me to be singing along to at that age but still. To this day P!nk is still one of my top artists of all time and I don't see that changing any time soon. Mam and I got to go to her concert last Summer in Dublin and I can safely say that that night is one of my most cherished memories. </p>

    <p>Growing up, she was an amazing woman to look up to. She has always preached that it's okay to be yourself and not fit in, as long as you were happy that was all that mattered. Most of her music is in my 'getting ready' playlist because you can't help but to jam along to her music. Or at least I can't amyways.</p>
